## Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

This project performs sentiment analysis on an Amazon product review dataset using R. The analysis leverages a combination of tidyverse for data manipulation, ggplot2 for data visualization, and corrplot for visualizing feature correlations. Sentiment scores are predicted using logistic regression to classify reviews into positive and negative sentiments. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and sentiment classification, followed by visualizations of sentiment distribution and correlations between review features.
